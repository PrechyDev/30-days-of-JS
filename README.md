# 30 DAYS OF JAVASCRIPT CHALLENGE

Hi everyone.

I'm starting a 30days of JavaScript challenge.
Everyday, I'm going to learn something new on JavaScript or build something new using JavaScript.
Whatever I do, I'll create a new file and commit it here on GitHub.

Wanna join me?  Spend at least 15mins learning or building something with JavaScript.

Don't forget to let others know what you're doing. Maybe some might want to join you.

Happy Coding Everyone!!!
